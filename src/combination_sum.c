/**
 * Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), 
 * find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.
 * 
 * The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.
 * Note:
 * All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
 * The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
 * A solution set is:
 * [
 *   [7],
 *   [2,2,3]
 * ]
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
 * A solution set is:
 * [
 *   [2,2,2,2],
 *   [2,3,3],
 *   [3,5]
 * ]
